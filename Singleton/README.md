# Key Points

**Definition**  
The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

**Description**  
A normal class can be instantiated many times.  
Singleton pattern ensures that the respective class can only be instantiated once.

**Example Usage**   
A commonly used class, for eg Logger class can be called by multiple classes throughout a project.    
In order to ensure easy maintenance, and also no resource-locking issues for shared resources (In the event of a single log file), Singleton pattern can help.
